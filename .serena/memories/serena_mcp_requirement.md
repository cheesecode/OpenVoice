# Serena MCP Requirement

This project requires the Serena MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for semantic search capabilities. Serena provides advanced code analysis tools including:

- Semantic symbol search and navigation
- Code structure analysis
- Symbol relationship mapping
- Intelligent code reading with minimal token usage
- Memory management for codebase understanding

The Serena MCP tools should be prioritized for code exploration and analysis tasks to avoid reading entire files unnecessarily.
